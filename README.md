# todo-app
A basic to-do app created with jQuery
With it, you can put everything that you need to remember, check if you already did the task and eliminate any of the items if it's
not longer necessary. 
With this app I developed a solid understanding of the jQuery selectors, the lenguage structure and the logic behind this little app.
